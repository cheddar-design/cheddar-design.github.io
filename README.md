Code BLUE and Emocode are both encryption languages. Code BLUE was developed by me and Emocode was created by one of my close friends. To use the encryptor, type your desired text into the encode field and press encode. The ouput is the encrypted message. Code BLUE cannot take numbers, emojis, or special characters.

I recommend encrypting a message through Code BLUE and then through Emocode. This double encrypted message will be hard to crack.
