# Code BLUE & Emocode encryptor/decryptor
Code BLUE and Emocode are both encryption languages. Code BLUE was developed by me and Emocode was created by one of my close friends. To use the encryptor, type your desired text into the encode field and press encode. The ouput is the encrypted message. Code BLUE cannot take numbers, emojis, or special characters.

The default mode (EmoBlue) encrypts a message through Code BLUE and then through Emocode. This double encrypted message will be hard to crack. You can choose to just use Code BLUE or EmoCode with the dropdown at the top of the screen.

The auto-clear fields switch will (when activated) cause the input field to self-clear 3 seconds after encoding/decoding.
